# KitsuneBot

<hr>
<p>This repo is meant to house the bare minimum template of KitsuneBot. At this moment KB isn't fully ready to become 100% open source! You may fork and edit this repo as much as you like and I look forward to seeing what you create from it!</p>
<p>This template includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easy command structure</li>
  <li>Pre-made error handling</li>
  <li>Pre-made help command with custom categories</li>
  <li>Custom presence code</li>
</ul>
